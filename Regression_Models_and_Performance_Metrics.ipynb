For example, it can be used to predict a student’s marks based on the number of hours studied. Overall, SLR is widely used for prediction, trend analysis, and making data-driven decisions."

The coefficient b is the slope of the line, representing how much Y changes for a one-unit increase in X; it shows the direction and strength of the relationship between the two variables. Finally, e is the error term, which captures the difference between the observed and predicted values of Y, accounting for random variations that cannot be explained by X.

In this case, the dependent variable (Y) is the exam score, and the independent variable (X) is the number of hours the student studies. By collecting data from several students about how long they studied and the marks they received, a simple linear regression model can be built to find a relationship between study time and exam performance. The model can then be used to predict future students’ scores based on how many hours they plan to study. This helps in understanding whether studying more hours leads to higher marks and how strongly the two variables are related."

In summary, logistic regression is used to predict probabilities and classify outcomes rather than estimating numeric values."
